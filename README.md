# NautilusFRCTemplate

## Overview
NautilusFRCTemplate is a standardized template created by Team 4010, a robotics team that competes in the FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC). This template is designed to be a foundation for all our future codebases, ensuring consistency, reliability, and ease of use across our projects.

## About Us
Team 4010, also known as Nautilus, is a dedicated group of students and mentors who are passionate about robotics and engineering. We participate in the FRC competitions, where we design, build, and program robots to compete in various challenges. Our goal is to inspire innovation, teamwork, and a love for STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics).

## Purpose of the Template
The NautilusFRCTemplate serves as a standard for all our coding projects. By using this template, we ensure that:
- Our code is organized and follows best practices.
- New team members can quickly understand and contribute to the codebase.
- We maintain a high level of code quality and consistency across different projects.
